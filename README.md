# React Componentization: Card Component with Factory Pattern

This repository provides an example of implementing a card component in a React project using componentization and the factory pattern. This README explains the importance of these practices and how to use the component in your projects.

## Why Componentization and Factory Pattern?

Componentization is crucial in software development for promoting code reusability, modularity, and maintainability. The factory pattern complements this by allowing object creation without specifying the exact class. By combining these two practices, we can create flexible and reusable components that instantiate different types of objects based on specific criteria.

## How to Use

1. **Installation**: Download or clone this repository to your development environment.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on your system. Then, run `npm install` to install project dependencies.

3. **Usage in Your Project**: Copy the `Card.tsx` file from `src/components/ui` to your React project directory.

4. **Data Storage**: Card data is stored in a separate file named `CardData.tsx`. Modify this file to manage card data.

5. **Import and Use**: In your project file, import the card component and data as needed:

   ```javascript
   import Card from "@/path/to/your/component/Card";
   import { cardItems, CardItem } from "@/path/to/your/data/file"; // Adjust the path as necessary

   export default function MyComponent() {
     return (
       <main>
         {cardItems.map(({ id, ...props }: CardItem) => (
           <Card key={id} {...props} />
         ))}
       </main>
     );
   }
   ```
